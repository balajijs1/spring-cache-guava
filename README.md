# spring-cache-guava

`spring-cache-guava` is a [Spring Framework Cache adapter](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/cache.html#cache-plug)
backed by [Google Guava](http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/).

### Build instructions

`spring-cache-guava` uses the Maven build system. Building the code yourself
should be a straightforward case of:

    git clone git@github.com:irbouho/spring-cache-guava.git
    cd spring-cache-guava
    mvn test

This should cause the modules to be compiled and the tests to be run. To
install these artifacts to your local Maven repo, use:

    mvn install

In a Maven project, one would include the runtime in the dependencies section
of your `pom.xml` (replacing `${spring-cache-guava.version}` with the
appropriate current release):

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.springmodules.cache.guava</groupId>
    <artifactId>core</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-cache-guava.version}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
